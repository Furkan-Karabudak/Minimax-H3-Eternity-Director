"""Save the last frame of a decoded batch, and pass the batch on untouched.

Sits directly after `VAEDecode`. Every H3 render ends on a frame worth keeping — it is the
one you feed back in as the next shot's opening keyframe — and fishing it out otherwise
means a second graph with `ImageFromBatch` wired to a `SaveImage`, rebuilt every time the
length changes.

Two things it deliberately does *not* do:

* **it never touches the pixels.** The IMAGE output is the same tensor object that came in,
  so putting this in the middle of a chain cannot change what anything downstream decodes,
  encodes or muxes. The passthrough is the point; saving is the side effect.
* **it does not need to be bypassed.** `save` is a widget rather than a reason to reach for
  Ctrl+B, because a node that has to be disabled between runs is a node that will be left
  enabled by accident.

The file, the counter, the `%date:…%` prefix tokens and the embedded workflow metadata are
core's, through `ImageSaveHelper` — so a frame saved here is a frame `SaveImage` would have
written, and the node body stays about *which* frame.
